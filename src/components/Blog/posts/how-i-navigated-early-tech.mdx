**Modern life is fast-paced.** It can be nice to take a step back to appreciate where you currently are, and what has brought you here. _Imposter syndrome_ is a real beast, so I think a bit of reflection and appreciation towards just how far you've come can go a long way in combating it.

### Early Experiencezzz

Going into my first real technical role as a **Data Engineering Intern** in mid-2022, I had a million questions, and was admittedly very intimidated. What would my day-to-day look like? How was I going to learn this entire stack from scratch while making impactful contributions? What is this _memoization_ thing I've read about? Did they just spell memorization wrong? Do I know enough yet??

As I began to work, I realized that although I had a lot to learn, I had a lot to offer too. And I'm not saying this to self-praise—I came to the realization that there is much more you can bring to an organization and dev team, other than code.

### My First PR

I'll never forget my first PR. Just a minor change to an _on-hover_ feature. But it was a feature used by several thousand users. Eventually, I was able to test it in nightly (our development environment) a week before the production release, which gave me a swift dose of both excitement and nerves. After that long week, the automated production release email had my bugfix in the patch notes. An audible exhale and a little smile—it was a good moment.

**I'm excited to continue to grow and learn** as I seek to invest myself in new, more challenging and impactful experiences.
